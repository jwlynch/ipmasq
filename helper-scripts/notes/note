in this directory, are reimplementations of the ipmasq tools:

  bcofif  default-if  enumerate-if  ipofif  nmofif  peerofif

using the info in /sys/class/net

TODO: default-if peerofif

just discovered that the new ip in the kernel.org version of iproute2 has a more complete
version of ip, and the json stuff works with ip route.

it's at git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/iproute2/iproute2.git

also, there is a cli program jq in the debian package of the same name, that parses json.

for example, "which device is the default route" can be answered using:

  ip -json route show exact 0.0.0.0/0 | jq .[0].dev
