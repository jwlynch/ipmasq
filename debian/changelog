ipmasq (3.5.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update sample Z99windows-smb-broadcast.rul to use specific protocols
    (which is required if you want to use ports).  (closes: #85126)

ipmasq (3.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added netfilter support (found in later 2.3.x and 2.4 kernels), patch
    provided by Arthur Peters <amep@softhome.net>. (closes: #68447, #69755)

ipmasq (3.4.4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed internal-ppp-peer bug. (closes: #58448)
  * Added sample Z99windows-smb-broadcast.rul designed to silence Windows
    SMB broadcasts from filling up syslog. (closes: #56334)
  * Added sample Z91kerneldynaddr.rul designed to let the kernel know about
    dynamic addresses (from the IP-Masquerade HOWTO)

    IP-Masquerade HOWTO)
  * Moved I50external and O50external to I90 and O90, respectively.  This

 -- Brian Bassett <brianb@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Jan 2000 15:09:15 -0800

ipmasq (3.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved informative prompt about conffiles from postinst to preinst

    from the distribution (closes: #49112)
  * Fixed default-if so that it will not report duplicates (closes:
    #47171)
  * Added I15lospoof.def to squash packets which have a source of

 -- Brian Bassett <brianb@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Nov 1999 16:16:59 -0800

ipmasq (3.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to Standards-Version 3.0.1, FHS.
  * ipmasq and crew now live in /usr/sbin (as opposed to /sbin).  They
    depend on cut and sort, which live in /usr/bin.
    + As a result, ipmasq has been moved until later in the boot sequence
      (i.e. after we know /usr (which could be NFS-mounted) is there).
      It now starts at 46 instead of at 41.
  * Added documentation. (closes: #40289)
    + Properly documents how to deal with odball networks (closes:
      #38213, #37433), diald (closes: #35862, #43970), and pcmcia
      (closes: #37636).
  * Fixed typo in O30internal.def (closes: #42121)
  * Internal point-to-point interfaces under 2.2 kernels now handled
    correctly.  Thanks go to Eric Stern <egstern@enteract.com> for the
    patch (closes: #41319)
  * --display is now the composition of --verbose and --no-act
    (closes: #40504)
    + As a side effect, the short option for --version is now -V.  Not a
      problem, as the short options are not canonical.
  * Added ZZZdenyandlog.def to log all denied packets to syslog.
    (closes: #40286)
  * Added ability to use rules files from directories other than
    /etc/ipmasq/rules by using the --rules switch.  Greatly simplifies
    testing and maintenance.
    + As a side effect, we can now implement `/etc/init.d/ipmasq stop`
      rather easily.  It removes all firewall rules, leaving the machine
      open.  Customize with rules files in the /etc/ipmasq/ipmasq-down
      directory.  (closes: #40290)
  * Change the wording of the header of the rules files to discourage
    editing instead of forbidding it.  Also bring the rules under dpkg
    conffile control.  (closes: #37406, #38218)
  * Closing bugs against 3.2.5 (slink version):
    + closes: #41351 (Fixed in 3.3.0)
    + closes: #41392 (Fixed in 3.3.0)
    + closes: #41643 (Fixed in 3.3.0)
