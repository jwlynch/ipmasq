Routing policy between internal interfaces can be one of the 3 options:

Option  Rule
   1)   simple forwarding (DEFAULT)
   2)   no forwarding     (Remove F30internal.rul.  Add F30bridge.rul from examples.)
   3)   masquerading      (Remove F30internal.rul.  Add F30masq.rul and F30bridge.rul from examples.)

Files are added to and removed from /etc/ipmasq/rules .

F30bridge.rul is needed if you have bridge set up (br?).

These examples should work but not tested on my box.
