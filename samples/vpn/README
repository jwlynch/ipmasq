Hello,

I created a simple script for ipmasq that creates rules for iptables.  It 
is written specifically for use with the vpnc package, but I believe it 
could be generalized by analyzing the routing tables.  I have very little 
experience with network routing and thus can't offer much help.

Until these tables are better understood, I would recommend leaving it as 
an example.

ath0 is just my wireless interface using the madwifi driver.  I would 
assume that "ath" is short for the Atheros chipset.
