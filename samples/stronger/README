  >> These will make into main script for post-sarge.
         --- If you have customized scripts in /etc/ipmasq/rules, 
             update after sarge release requires extra care.

A80firewall.def configurations. (Blocks nothing)
I80firewall.def rules for incoming packet
O80firewall.def rules for outgoing packet
I79ident.def    sends REJECT for external AUTH requests.
