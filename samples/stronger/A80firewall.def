# Packet filter firewall script for ipmasq (GPL)
#       By Osamu Aoki <osamu@aokiconsulting.com>= osamu@debian.org
#
# Firewall is set for external network connection ports listed in $EXTERNAL
# Little consideration taken for shared port, eth0:0, etc.  (Deny=Drop)
#
#
# You can only use port name if /etc/service is locally available. (not LDAP)
# This is because ipmasq sets a default-deny policy while setting up rules
# dynamically and blocking access to ldap server which is outside of firewall.
# If protocol names are used iptables occupies over 1000 MiB of memory.                                                                                             
# Replacing protocol names with numbers solves the problem.
