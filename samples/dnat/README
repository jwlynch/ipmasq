C50dnat.rul

This script is a simplified example of DNAT of submitted by 
milon@wq.cz with below mail.  Please file bug to Debian package 
for any issues or suggestions to this one.  (despite what he said.)

Osamu made this script to be POSIX script while Daniel tested and 
refined the script.  You can trust Daniel better than me :-)

But this may still have problems since even Daniel has problem getting
this to work.  

Please edit this script for your need.

Sample rules for enabling DNAT with iptables using packet's marking.
This example is limited for fixed external IP but can handle multiple
DNAT using BASH array.

Due to the routing changes in iptables section with security concern, 
only set DNAT is not enough.

I am not shell scripter, so excuse my shell constructions :-))

All changes address to ipmasq maintainer, please milon@wq.cz

Since ipmasq should be POSIX shell script, there may be some issues
using BASH if you set /bin/sh to non-BASH.
